# New Relic Java Agent Instrumentation for Micronaut HTTP Components

New Relic Java Agent instrumentation for HTTP components of Micronaut (https://micronaut.io/)

## Installation

To install:

1. Download the latest release jar files.
2. In the New Relic Java directory (the one containing newrelic.jar), create a directory named extensions if it does not already exist.
3. Copy the downloaded jars into the extensions directory.
4. Restart the application.   

## Building

Building the extension requires that Gradle is installed.
To build the extension jars from source, follow these steps:
### Build single extension
To build a single extension with name *extension*, do the following:
1. Set an environment variable *NEW_RELIC_EXTENSIONS_DIR* and set its value to the directory where you want the jar file built.
2. Run the command: gradlew *extension*:clean *extension*:install
### Build all extensions
To build all extensions, do the following:
1. Set an environment variable *NEW_RELIC_EXTENSIONS_DIR* and set its value to the directory where you want the jar file built.
2. Run the command: gradlew clean install
